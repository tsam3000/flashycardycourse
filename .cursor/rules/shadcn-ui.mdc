# shadcn/ui Usage

This project uses **shadcn/ui** for all UI elements.

## Initialization

If shadcn/ui is not initialized in the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

To add a specific component (for example, the button component), use:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Component Usage

- Always prefer shadcn/ui components over custom implementations
- Components are located in `src/components/ui/` after installation
- Import components from `@/components/ui/[component-name]`

## Common Components

When building UI features, consider using these shadcn/ui components:
- `button` - For all button interactions
- `card` - For content containers
- `input` - For form inputs
- `dialog` - For modals and dialogs
- `form` - For form handling with validation
- `toast` - For notifications
- `dropdown-menu` - For dropdown menus
- `table` - For data tables
- `tabs` - For tabbed interfaces

Install any component as needed with `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`.
